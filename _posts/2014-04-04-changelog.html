    <h1>Data Commons Change Report</h1>

    <div class="changes" id="intro">

      The Data Commons Co-op is beginning to systematically archive
      databases, spreadsheets, or online lists.  The Change Report
      is an experiment in giving our members insight into the scope
      of the data the co-op holds on their behalf.  For now, we give
      raw listings of new material that has come in.
