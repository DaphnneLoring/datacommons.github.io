<h3>Data for the Commons</h3>

<div class="section">
  
<p>New data is slowly, but steadily flowing into
the the Data Commons! Over the last month, we've been reaching out to
founding members and bringing in baseline data.  Our strategy is to
establish this most basic foundation and then build from there.  Our
latest contributions include data sets from the Cooperative
Development Institute (CDI) and hOurworld.  CDI's data includes their
partners, collaborators, and entities that have reached out to them
for assistance, while hOurworld's data includes a comprehensive
directory of service exchanges, often known as time banks.  Many
thanks to all the members that have already submitted data to the
commons.  If you would like to submit additional data sets or to know
more about sharing data with the cooperative, please contact

<h3>Manitoba</h3>

<div class="section">

<p>Manitoba Cooperative Association (MCA) is a provincial association
of cooperatives.  Our membership is broad and reflects the diversity
of the cooperative community in Manitoba.</p>

<p>In 2008, a partnership was struck between MCA, the Province of
Manitoba and the Conseil de développement économique des municipalités
(CDEM) to create a strategy which would stimulate, broaden and sustain
the development of a socially and economically successful Manitoba
cooperative community.  One of the aims of the strategy is to enhance
collaboration among cooperatives and what better way to do that than
to create a database of Manitoba cooperatives showcasing the various
goods and services that Manitoba co-ops provide.</p>

<p>MCA joined Data Commons in 2013 and is now in the process of
gathering information from the over 400 Manitoba cooperatives to
populate its' database.  As you can well imagine, this is a daunting
task but one which has been made much easier with the assistance of
Data Commons.  We truly appreciate their professionalism and advice
and are really looking forward to seeing the end result of our
database project.</p>

<p>If you have any tips for us in creating the database or would like
to learn more about Manitoba's cooperative strategy, we'd love to hear
from you.  Please contact <a

<h3>New Economics Institute</h3>

<div class="section">

<p>Exciting news! The New Economy Coalition (NEC) has teamed up with a
worker cooperative web firm called the Palante Technology to redesign
and build out their online portal for mapping a green and fair world,
GTNE.org. NEC's contract with Palante Tech included a series of
conversations with the Data Commons Cooperative to ensure that the
website's data standards were optimized for sharing with other members
of the DCC. GTNE.org will be mobile friendly via a responsive design
and is scheduled to be completed in early March. If you have any
questions, contact <a href="http://member.find.coop/contact/eli">Eli

<h3>Solidarity Economy Network</h3>

<div class="section">

<p>In September 2013, the U.S. government’s National Science Foundation
(NSF) funded five researchers (two economists, two geographers, and one
political scientist) to study the solidarity economy in the eastern
United States. The grant covers two years of research at four
research sites representing different population scales: New York City
(pop. 8.2 million); Philadelphia (pop. 1.5 million); Worcester,
MA (pop. 180,000), and Western Mass., which is home
to large number of rural communities. One portion of the grant covers 
creation of an interactive website that will display the data collected
about the solidarity economy. Data Commons connected the SEN researchers
to <a href="http://www.parit.ca/">ParIT</a>, a web developer worker co-op 
member of the <a href="http://member.find.coop/">Canadian Worker Co-op 
Federation</a>, and encouraged the team to consider development that 
would be compatible with the overall goals of the Data Commons. That work
is now in progress!</p>
